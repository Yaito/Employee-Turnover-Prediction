## Title
Random Forest Classifier for Employees Turnover Prediction

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a classifier and random forest model to predict whether an employee is at risk of leaving a company or not. This project utilized employees data from a fictitions company called Salifort Motors. The final random forest model achieved an AUC of 96.5%, a recall of 87% and a precision of 86%, finding what features best determined the conditions that would produce employee turnover for Salifort Motors. The model also outperformerd moderately the other models that was tested during the modeling process. (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees). Based on the model, last evaluation, number of projects, tenure and whether an employee was overworked, were the most influential featues in determining if and employee is staying or leaving the company.

## Modeling and Evaluation
A random forest model comprising 500 decision trees was used to determine feature importance in which employees would leave or stay. The below plot shows that last evaluation, number of projects, tenure, and the fact whether an employee was overworked or not were among the Top 4 most important factors in determining a employee leaving or staying. The overall model performed with 89.8% recall, 87.1% precision and an AUC of 93.5%.
